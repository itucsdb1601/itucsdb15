Parts Implemented by Ozan Ozcan
================================
The classes created by Ozan Ã–zcan are universities, academics and unisports. All of the classes have the same header in order to import and implement the functionality of json, psycopg2 and flask. url_for will be used to redirect pages.

.. code-block:: python
   import json
  import os
  import psycopg2 as dbapi2
  import re
  from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect
  from flask.helpers import url_for

  app = Flask(__name__)
  
The tables will be dropped and re-created every time the database is initialized. Dropping operation is done to prevent any errors in table creation.

.. code-block:: python

  class university:

	def initialize_universities(config):
		with dbapi2.connect(config) as connection:
			cursor = connection.cursor()
			query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS UNIVERSITYLIST CASCADE;"""
			cursor.execute(query)
			query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS UNIVERSITYTYPE CASCADE;"""
			cursor.execute(query)
			query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS UNICITY CASCADE;"""
			cursor.execute(query)
			query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS UNIPOPULARITY CASCADE;"""
			cursor.execute(query)
   
      
      
With the following query and subsequent cursor.execute(query) command, the first table of the class, which is university list, is created. This table has 5 attributes.

.. code-block:: python

  query = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UNIVERSITYLIST (uni_id serial primary key, unicity_id VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL, uni_name  VARCHAR(80)   NOT NULL, unitype_id VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL, startdate VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL);"""
			cursor.execute(query)

- uni_id serial primary key: This is the primary key of the table. Each time a tuple is created in this table, uni_id will be incremented. For example, if the last element of the table has an id of 4, the subsequent entry to this table will have an uni_id of 5.

- unicity_id VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL: This value was initially an integer. But we have encountered some problems while trying to fetch data from user in html page as an integer. For our project to run in Bluemix without any issues, this value was switched to VARCHAR and takes a string as input. Originally, it would take an integer and then this integer would be used in another table. It is not null so there will be an error if this id is left blank in initial elements or when a user is trying to enter a new tuple to this list.

- uni_name VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL: This is the most important attribute of the table. This table is connected to other tables via uni_name. uni_name will hold the name of the university and obviously shouldn't be left blank.

- unitype_id VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL: Like city id number, this was also an integer converted to string to not break the website. The database will take the id and use it to elaborate on which category this particular university is considered in.

- startdate VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL: Another integer converted to string. The date the university is founded is stored in this attribute.

.. code-block:: python

  query = """INSERT INTO UNIVERSITYLIST(uni_name, unitype_id, unicity_id, startdate) VALUES ('Istanbul Technical University','1','34',      '1773'), ('Harvard University', '5', '999', '1850'), ('Mersin University','2','33', '1933'), ('Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University', '3',    '34', '1802'), ('SUNY Buffalo', '5', '999', '1898');"""
			cursor.execute(query)
			connection.commit();

To make sure the insert operations were done, all of the tables which will be created will have a few tuples inserted in them. Each time the database is initialized, these values are restored and presented in the html file.

.. code-block:: python

			query = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UNIVERSITYTYPE (type_id serial primary key, unitype VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL);"""
			cursor.execute(query)

Universitytype table consists of two attributes. It was planned to take the unitype_id from the Universitylist table and give the necessary information about the type of the university in this table

- type_id serial primary key

- unitype: This attribute contains the explanation of the type.

.. code-block:: python 

			query = """INSERT INTO UNIVERSITYTYPE (unitype) VALUES ('Public Technical University'), ('Public University'), ('Sports and Arts University'), ('Private University'), ('Foreign University');"""
			cursor.execute(query)
      
.. code-block:: python 

			query = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UNICITY (city_id INTEGER, city_name VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL);"""
			cursor.execute(query)

Unicity table also has two attributes and will list the cities in which the universities are located. If it is a unversity based in Turkey, it's city licence plate number will be its unicity id, if it is a foreign university it's default value is 999.

.. code-block:: python 

  query = """INSERT INTO UNICITY VALUES (34,'Istanbul'), (35,'Izmir'), (999,'Foreign'), (33, 'Mersin'),(6,'Ankara'), (1,'Adana'), (7,'Antalya');"""
			cursor.execute(query)

If a university with a different city code is added to the Universitylist table, the code and the city name should be added to this table.

.. code-block:: python

			query = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UNIPOPULARITY (popularity_id INTEGER  primary key, uni_name VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL, totalscore INTEGER, totalusers INTEGER NOT NULL);"""
			cursor.execute(query)

  
Unipopularity table has four attributes.
  
- popularity_id integer primary key

- uni_name VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL

- totalscore INTEGER

- totalusers INTEGER NOT NULL

	Popularity of a university will be evaluated in this table. The total users enrolled in a certain university will be held. The total score is an algorithm calculated by the votes users will give to a certain university, and their academic and athletic accomplishments.
  

.. code-block:: python

			query = """INSERT INTO UNIPOPULARITY VALUES	(15, 'Gazi University', 10954, 322), (22, 'Izmir University', 2559, 210);"""
			cursor.execute(query)
			connection.commit();
			return 'University Tables Created <a href="http://localhost:5000">Home</a>'
      
      
      
After the last commit, a blank page will open in the browser saying that the tables are created for this class.

.. code-block:: python

	def universities_page(config):
		with dbapi2.connect(config) as connection:
			if request.method == 'GET':
				cursor = connection.cursor()
				query = "SELECT uni_name, startdate from UNIVERSITYLIST"
				cursor.execute(query)
				return render_template('universities.html', unis=cursor)
        

After the table creation operation is processed, certain methods for this class is written. The first method universities_page is used to get data from Universitylist table to be used in universities main html page. 

.. code-block:: python 

	def saveuniversity(config):
		uni_name = None
		unitype_id = None
		unicity_id = None
		startdate = None
		if request.method == 'POST':
			unitype_id = request.form['unitype_id']
			print(unitype_id)
			unicity_id = request.form['unicity_id']
			print(unicity_id)
			uni_name = request.form['uniname_text']
			print(uni_name)
			startdate = request.form['founded']
			print(startdate)
			with dbapi2.connect(config) as connection:
				cursor = connection.cursor()
				query = """INSERT INTO UNIVERSITYLIST(uni_name, unitype_id, unicity_id, startdate) VALUES (%s, %s, %s , %s)"""
				cursor.execute(query, (uni_name, unicity_id, unitype_id, startdate ))
				connection.commit();
				return redirect(url_for('universities'))
        
 
The method shown above will be used to get necessary information to add a new university to the database. This method will be used in university_add.html page.

.. code-block:: python
	def universities_page_delete(config, deleteuniversities):
		with dbapi2.connect(config) as connection:
			cursor = connection.cursor()
			query = """DELETE FROM UNIVERSITYLIST WHERE uni_name=%s"""
			cursor.execute(query, (deleteuniversities,))
			connection.commit();
			return redirect(url_for('universities'))

	def universities_page_update(config, updateuniversities):
		with dbapi2.connect(config) as connection:
			cursor = connection.cursor()
			query = """SELECT uni_name from UNIVERSITYLIST WHERE uni_name = '%s'""" % (updateuniversities)
			cursor.execute(query)
			connection.commit();
			return render_template('universities_edit.html', uni=cursor)

	def universities_page_update_apply(config,updateuniversities):
		with dbapi2.connect(config) as connection:
			cursor = connection.cursor()
			new_uni = request.form['uname']
			print(new_uni)
			try:
				query="""UPDATE UNIVERSITYLIST set uni_name = '%s' where uni_name = '%s'""" % (new_uni,updateuniversities)
				cursor.execute(query)
				connection.commit()
				return redirect(url_for('universities'))
			except:
				return 'update is done'
        
        
Delete and update methods are implemented in the universities main page. There are links for delete and update in table where universities are listed. When delete is pressed, the delete method will delete the selected university. When update is pressed, universities_edit.html page will open and the user will update the selected university. The apply method is used to save the changes made.


UNISPORTS:

.. code-block:: python

  class unisports:
    def initialize_unisports(config):
        with dbapi2.connect(config) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS UNITEAMS CASCADE;"""
            cursor.execute(query)
            query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS UNILEAGUES CASCADE;"""
            cursor.execute(query)
            query = """DROP TABLE IF EXISTS COMPETITION CASCADE;"""
            cursor.execute(query)
            
The unisports class is initialized in this method. The tables are dropped to be created in initialization.

.. code-block:: python

            query = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UNITEAMS (team_id serial primary key, uni_name VARCHAR(80) UNIQUE NOT NULL, team_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL);"""
            cursor.execute(query)
 
 
The first table of this class is Uniteams. This table has 3 attributes.

- team_id serial primary key

- uni_name VARCHAR(80) UNIQUE NOT NULL

- team_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL

	This table will list the team names of the affiliated university.
  
.. code-block:: python

            query = """INSERT INTO UNITEAMS (uni_name, team_name) VALUES ('Istanbul Technical University','Hornets'), ('Harvard University', 'Crimson'), ('Mersin University','Mustangs'), ('SUNY Buffalo', 'Bulls'), ('Bogazici University', 'Sultans');"""
            cursor.execute(query)
            
.. code-block:: python
            query = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UNILEAGUES (league_id serial primary key, league_name VARCHAR(80) UNIQUE NOT NULL, country_id INTEGER    NOT NULL);"""
            cursor.execute(query)
            
The unileagues table will be used to list the different teams that belongs to this university. This table has 3 attributes.

- league_id serial primary key

- league_name VARHCAR(80) UNIQUE NOT NULL: the team must be playing in a unique league. 2 teams from same university cannot play in the same league. 

- country_id INTEGER NOT NULL: used to determine if the team is playing in a domestic or international competition.

.. code-block:: python
            query = """INSERT INTO UNILEAGUES (league_name, country_id) VALUES ('NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision', 5), ('Istanbul Basketbol Ligi', 90), ('Universiteler Spor Ligi', 90), ('IFAF Europe Champions League', 5);"""
            cursor.execute(query)
            
As it can be seen from this example, different leagues with respective country codes are listed.

.. code-block:: python
            query = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS COMPETITION (id serial primary key, country_id INTEGER NOT NULL, competition_type VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL);"""
            cursor.execute(query)
This table has 3 attributes; id, country_id and competition_type. 

.. code-block:: python

            query = """INSERT INTO COMPETITION (country_id, competition_type) VALUES (90, 'Domestic Intercollegiate'), (5, 'Foreign Tournament');"""
            connection.commit()
            return 'University Sport Tables Created <a href="http://localhost:5000">Home</a>'
            
After the last table of this class is created, the app will post a message informing the successful table creations.
